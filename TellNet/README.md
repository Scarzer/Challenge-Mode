# Tell Net I said Hi!
### Greetings and welcome @Challengers!

Your objective? Implement a basic telnet client in the language of your choice.

To qualify your program must be able to receive and comunicate across a local telnet connection.
All storage and processing for this challenge (including the bonuses)* must be local to the machine.
You are not allowed to use another system to monitor or store user information.  

This will net you **5000 CST**.

#### Bonus points:
- [ ] **5000** - Allow your program to accept all incoming TCP and UDP connections and attempt to communicate across them,
- [ ] **5000** - Implement a server process that can connect your clients together and allow them to communicate.
- [ ] **5000** - Allow your server to accept websocket connections so that a web client can connect to and communicate on your server.
- [ ] **10000** - Replace your server backend with an interface to Discord such that your clients can be used as discord clients. This means that you will need to auth users and account for network errors and downtime. You may choose what discord information is available to the client.

## This challenge is worth a total of **30000** tokens!

Partial completion of tasks will be awarded partial points!  
Please submit your challenges via the discord channel as a gist or repo link!  

***GOOD LUCK***  
***HAPPY CODING***
