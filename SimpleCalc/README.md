# 1 + 1 = ?
### Greetings and welcome @Challengers!

Your objective? Implement a simple, no precedence calculator in your language of choice!
The catch? You are going to be using a FSM to calculate the values.

To qualify your program must have a fixed amount of accepted states and can only process one character of the expression at a time. You will not be able to look ahead or behind, only at the current character. You are allowed a single 'register' or variable to store the 'state' of your program which in this case should be the value of the expression. You are only allowed one function/method, but this may have as many lines as you wish. If your language supports multiple function bodies, then you may use as many as necessary. The minimum requirement is to be able to extract an integer value from a list of characters. Such as receiving '123' and returning 123 as the value. This will net you **2000 CST**.

#### Bonus points:
- [ ] **1000** - Add support for the + operator such that '12+1' returns 13
- [ ] **1000** - Add support for the - operator such that '12-1' returns 11
- [ ] **1000** - Add support for the * operator such that '12*1' returns 12
- [ ] **1000** - Add support for the / operator such that '12/1' returns 12
- [ ] **2000** - Add support for floating point parsing such that '12.1' returns 12.1
- [ ] **3000** - Add support for the () operators such that '(12+1)*2' returns 26 and '12+1*1' returns 13
- [ ] **5000** - Add operator precedence to your calculator. For this bonus, you are allowed one additional register and one stack in your state machine.

## This challenge is worth a total of **16000** tokens!
