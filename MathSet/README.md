# It's A Setup!
### Greetings and welcome to the first new challenge for all @Challengers!

Your objective? Implement a mathematical set type in your language of choice!

To qualify you must have functions/methods to create a set with 0 or more initial members, add and remove items from the set and determine if an item is a member of the set. This will net you **3000 CST**.

#### Bonus points:
- **1000** - Extend your set membership function to also allow to check if a given set is a subset of - another set
- **1000** - Add an additional method to generate all the power sets of a given set
- **3000** - Implement Unions, Intersections, and Complements for your set type
- **2000** - Implement Cartesian Products for your set type
- **1000** - For *unique* implementations.

## This challenge is worth a total of **11000** tokens!

Partial completion of tasks will be awarded partial points!  
Please submit your challenges via the discord channel as a gist or repo link!
